## VRC over Under
### Description
The game is that any team must get the most amount of points within a certain amount of time. The time frame is 15 sec of autonomous mode and 1 min & 45 sec of driver-controlled mode. Each triball scored in the goal is worth 5 points. Each triball scored on an offensive zone is worth 2 points.When the round is in the closing stages. The teams will undergo a elevation end game, where the robot hangs off a pipe and scores points according to how high off the ground the wheels are.

### Our Strategy
* Our goal is to be able to get the triballs in our goal since we can't grab the triballs from the loading zone as efficiently as we hoped. At the end of the round, we plan to try and elevate our robot just a little to see if we can get extra points.

## Our Robot

### The Base
Our X-drive holonomic base is a 4 motor base design that needed custom cut C channels. We were able to compartmentalize each arm making it easy to conduct maintenace each motor. We built it last year and we think it can still be competitive this year as well with a couple of [developments](EngineeringNotebook/baseDesign.md.md)


### The Arm and Scooper 
Our whole entire upper half came from VEX's Striker bot. We adapted it to our base by adapting some parts in and adding some supports so the top portion can fit comfortably. Images can be found on entry [10 14](EngineeringNotebook/10_14_notebook_entry.md) and [10 26](EngineeringNotebook/10_26_notebook_entry.md)

### Elevation Mechanism
We have not found out a viable solution for the elevation idea. We had the idea for hooks but it just isn't sturdy enough. For this competetion we will be missing out on some points. This [entry](EngineeringNotebook/10_26_notebook_entry.md) contains our possible solution.
