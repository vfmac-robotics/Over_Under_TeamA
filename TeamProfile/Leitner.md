# Evan Leitner
## Bio
I live in Delmar, MD, but I go to school at Valley Forge Military Academy (VFMA). When I graduate I want to gravitate toward learning things in college that would help me in pursuing a job as either a Bear biologist or a Video game designer.

## Role: Builder
 I consider myself a builder because I literally build parts of the robot and help build the ideas that our team may have if we want to include them.
