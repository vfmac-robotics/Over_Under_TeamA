### Ideas
* Code the robot to shove the tribal in

	#### Explanation: 
	We have trouble consistently getting the triballs into the goal with the scoop. So a possible solution would be to code a button to rotate the robot and automatically push the triball in.
	#### rough sketch of coding:
()OnButtonPress
	ReleaseTriball()
	RetractArm()
	RotateDegrees(90)
	MoveTowardNet()


(show excalidraw that leitner is making)

* Add posts to the triball arms for elevation bar
* Replace small omni wheels with big ones to be able to jump over the pvc pipe.(Stated in the rules that it wasn't allowed)
* if we get pneumatic parts, we can point them at the ground and we get boosted up above the gray pipe like a jet pack. (Wouldn't work; the robot is too heavy)
* Put retractable flaps and play goalie/ push the triballs in. (It wouldn't work due to our holonomic drive.)
* Build a claw mechanism that goes on the back of the robot, (Team voted against it after the robot was built.)
* Fill the loading zone of the scooper with polycarbonate. (The triball point rests a little below the loading zone and obstructing that would be catastrophic.)
* Push robot underneath the net to try and push triballs through the side from the front of the net.(It would end up not being able to fit and move because of where our gears sit on our robot as well as the gaurdds for the pegs of the nets.)
