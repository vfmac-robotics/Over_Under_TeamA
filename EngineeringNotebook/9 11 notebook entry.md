Today, We went over the striker directions to assess how we could fit the top portion of the bot on top of the _X-drive_. We decided to take apart the supports that were on the top of the robot and move it towards the bottom to make space on the floor of the bot. In addition to that, we need to close the gap, but took a double take at the end and realized we didn't need to shorten the _Homonomic_ base and wasted 10 minutes.
