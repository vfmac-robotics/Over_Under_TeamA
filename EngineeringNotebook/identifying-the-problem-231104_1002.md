## **1. Identify the Problem**

- The game is that any team must get the most amount of points within a certain amount of time. The time frame is 15 sec of autonomous mode and 1 min & 45 sec of driver-controlled mode.
- **Autonomous Period** -- A time period during which robots operate and react only to sensor inputs and commands pre-programmed by the team into the robot's brain. 
- **Driver Controlled Period** -- A time period during which drive team members to operate their robot via remote control.
- **Scoring Points** â€“ Each triball scored in the goal is worth 5 points. Each triball scored on an offensive zone is worth 2 points.
- **Elevation Tiers -**  When the round is in the closing stages. The teams will undergo a elevation end game, where the robot hangs off a pipe and scores points according to how high off the ground the wheels are.

## **2. Brainstorm, Diagram, or Prototype Solutions**

- **Brainstorming** -- Solutions to this would be to create a mechanism that would grab triballs and transport them either to the other side of the field or score points in goals on either side of the feild
- **Possible Solutions**
        - Grabber Solutions
                - Striker Bot
- **Ideas we Have**
        - Add posts to the tribal arms to climb up onto the bar (fill the "loading zone" with polycarbonate)
        - Add a claw to take triballs out of the goals (put on the back of our robot)
                        - Whatever we use to grab the triballs has to grip since the triballs are plastic and slightly slippery
        - Replace small omni-wheels with big ones to be able to jump over PVC pipe
        - If we ever got access to pneumatic parts, we could point them at the ground to get boosted up above the gray PVC pipe like a jetpack
        - Create extendable flaps to play golie annd to also push some triballs out of the goal.

## 3. Select Best Solution

& Plan

- **Plan** -- Our goal is to be able to get the triballs in our goal since we can't grab the triballs from the loading zone as efficiently as we hoped. At the end of the round, we plan to try and elevate our robot just a little to see if we can get extra points.
- **Best Solution**
        - We ended up wanting to stick with the striker bot design but kept our previous base design (the x-drive) because we felt that it worked best with our base and it was easy to build for the upcoming competition.
        - Our plan is to add the functions of the arm and scoop motors to our program so that our robot will be fully functional.
        - Add posts to the arm so we can climb the elevation pole near the end of the round. 
        - Now we only experimented so we don't know what works best, but we are doing this to help create an idea for what we may want on the future robot.

## 4. How We Built our Robot and its Program

- **How We Built the Solution**
        - Our team built the solution by using the x-drive base that we made last year so that we don't spend time in an area of the robot that is finished. 
        - Then we added to it the arm and scoop from the striker bot instructions to help with being able to grab and score triballs in the net. Adding the striker bot parts was difficult because we had to rearrange how it fit on our already made base from last year for it to work and look properly.
- **How We Programmed the Solution**
        - We programmed the base last year with quite a bit of struggle trying to figure out which direction the wheels should turn and when it should turn in that direction, and vice versa.
        - While trying the code for the arm and scoop from the striker bot, we decided to see what a sample code looked like for coding what we wanted in VEX5 code. We ended up using what we found, but modified it to make it correlate to the motor names and ports of what we planned on connecting certain motors to.

## 6. Repeating the Design Process

    Over the course of making the robot we have tested the robot on our field to see if anything comes back bad. For example:

        - We tested if the wires would come loose or not work while being in use for a long time. (The wire kept disconnecting so we had to replace it. Works better now.)
        - We tested if the scoop could be smaller on the robot. (It ended up not working the way we planned and didn't follow through for the competition.)
        - We also would drive around our field to see if there was anything we could do to make the game more in our team's favor. One of our teammates thought of making a button press that would enact a program to score a triball. (Haven't made it yet)
        - We tried to see what we would need to elevate our robot to the best of its ability, but the robot cannot lock yet so the robot will fall from gravity. (We found where the robot can grab the pole to lift and it worked, but would fall if not held there by the controller making it.)
        - On our robot base (X-drive) we tested so many times on whether or not the wheels would fit or even if the program would work right. The X-drive is definitely difficult to make, but it is rewarding to have it feeling pretty sturdy and well-made the following year.
