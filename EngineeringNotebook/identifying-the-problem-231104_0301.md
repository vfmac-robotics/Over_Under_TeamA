## **Identify the Problem**

- The game is that any team must get the most amount of points within a certain amount of time. The time frame is 15 sec of autonomous mode and 1 min & 45 sec of driver-controlled mode.
- **Autonomous Period** -- A time period during which robots operate and react only to sensor inputs and commands pre-programmed by the team into the robot's brain. 
- **Driver Controlled Period** -- A time period during which drive team members to operate their robot via remote control.
- **Scoring Points** â€“ Each triball scored in the goal is worth 5 points. Each triball scored on an offensive zone is worth 2 points.
- **Elevation Tiers -**

## **Brainstorm, Diagram, or Prototype Solutions**

- **Brainstorming** -- Solutions to this would be to create a mechanism that would grab triballs and transport them either to the other side of the field or score points in goals on either side of the feild
- **Possible Solutions**
        - Grabber Solutions
                - Striker Bot
- Ideas we Have
        - Add posts to the tribal arms to climb up onto the bar (fill the "loading zone" with polycarbonate)
        - Add a claw to take triballs out of the goals (put on the back of our robot)
                        - Whatever we use to grab the triballs has to grip since the triballs are plastic and slightly slippery
        - Replace small omni-wheels with big ones to be able to jump over PVC pipe
        - If we ever got access to pneumatic parts, we could point them at the ground to get boosted up above the gray PVC pipe like a jetpack
        - Create extendable flaps to play golie annd to also push some triballs out of the goal.

## Select Best Solution

& Plan

- **Plan** -- Our goal is to be able to get the triballs in our goal since we can't grab the triballs from the loading zone as efficiently as we hoped. At the end of the round, we plan to try and elevate our robot just a little to see if we can get extra points.
- **Best Solution**
        - We ended up wanting to stick with the striker bot design but kept our previous base design (the x-drive) because we felt that it worked best with our base and it was easy to build for the upcoming competition.
        - Our plan is to add the functions of the arm and scoop motors to our program so that our robot will be fully functional.
        - Add posts to the arm so we can climb the elevation pole near the end of the round. 
        - Now we only experimented so we don't know what works best, but we are doing this to help create an idea for what we may want on the future robot.
