### Today's Task: Figure out an elevation method

#### Current Plan: 
We have an idea of dropping the claw right under the elevation pipe and retracting it, lifting us about an inch off the ground.

#### Flaw:
Only the back two wheels levitate off the ground.


#### Idea:
Create a hook like mechanism on the back of the scooper arm. It would need to be sturdy enough to handle the weight of the entire robot.
