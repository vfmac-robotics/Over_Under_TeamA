Today, We went over the striker directions to assess how we could fit the top portion of the bot on top of the Holonomic drive. We decided to take apart the supports that were on the top of the robot towards the bottom to make space on the floor of the bot to open up space. In addition to that, we need to close the gap, but took a double take at the end and realized we didn't need to shorten the Homonomic base and wasted 10 minutes.
