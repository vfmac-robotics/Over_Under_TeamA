The robot and the [field](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1160312586944925860/1160313813413941278/IMG_6823.JPG?ex=65343572&is=6521c072&hm=187072d5633d1052102ea2970f9c60f7ea0ea899ca40999357206817b0847a1c&) were completed on the same day. There are some obvious build flaws. Like the resting position of the robot was wrong so we had to move our spacers back a bit. We attached the triball grabber on the wrong way and had to flip it around. The wiring is in a mess but that will all be neat and complete by the time of our first competition. For our second year, I think we're doing really well on time management.

#### Flaws on this robot:
* We exceed the 18 in limit
* It appears to be quite fragile 
* poor build quality (fixable)
* Holonomic drive hinders our ability to attach things on our base making the tank drive better overall choice for the challenge but we'll stick with it anyways.
* Our triball grabber is draolgging and we fear that it'll interfere with our ability to actually pick up the triball.
* The top of the triball grabber scrapes the 11.63 in clearance when crossing over to the ally/enemy zone. 
* The resting position of the triball grabber is dragging.
* **Solution**: We moved the wheel that was **SUPPOSED** to limit its range of motion but now the range of motion was limited too much. Now we had to adjust it somewhere in the middle which solved our positioning issue.
