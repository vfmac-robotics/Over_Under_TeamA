We asked ourselves today, "Does the resting position of the scoop need to be slanted? We took off the back supports of the scooper need to be slanted?" One member thought that it didn't matter and another member said it did. We took off the back supports of the scooper arm. and observed some changes and how it would act if we bolted it back on like that. As we did the pros and cons of this, the cons by far outweighed the positives. 

### Pros
1. It's an easy method to get into the size restriction

2. It increases or reach radius without having to extend the scooper's arm supports with larger c channels 

### Cons
1. Scoop scrapes on the floor and damages field
2. If horizontally mounted, the ability to cross the field due to the elevation bar

Deciding not to take another risk to sacrifice practice time, we chose to get rid of the 35 arm support in exchange for a 25 rail. Hopefully with an upgrade like this,  it will improve the sturdiness of the robot and the contact points of the rubber flaps of the scooper

An hour later, when all the supports were swapped, we fell into instant relief. One problem was solved and another was created though. Our resting position was compromised in the progress; It was too high to grab a triball. 
### Trial and error toward the solution:
* We moved the rubber wheel up a couple pegs up on the c channel
* We got rid of the bottom supports 
* Got a small chain and gear to put tank treads on it

Lastly, we kept the chain on it and it felt secure and a stable fit. 

Today was a great day productivity wise and we can finally picture ourselves with a decent robot.
